### Overview

This work describes a submission to the [acoustic scene classification task](www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/arg/dcase2017/challenge/task-acoustic-scene-classification) of the [DCASE 2017 challenge](cs.tut.fi/sgn/arg/dcase2017/). The study is based on the following premises:

- The prevailing tendency of convolutional neural network models employed in audio classification tasks is to utilize spectrogram representations limited to 40-60 mel frequency bands. Higher values are rarely chosen despite the additional granularity they introduce:

    <p align="center"><img src="_images/spectrograms.gif" alt="Comparison of spectrograms with different frequency resolutions" title="Comparison of spectrograms with different frequency resolutions" /></p>
    
    Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to check **how using spectrograms with different frequency resolutions could impact the accuracy in this task**.

- Most acoustic scenes can be described as a combination of a recurring background (ambient noise) mixed with distinct foreground elements (sound events). Still, [Mafra et al. **(2016)**](https://www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/arg/dcase2016/documents/workshop/SenaMafra-DCASE2016workshop.pdf) have shown that even a single averaged frame can have a good predictive capacity in acoustic scene classification tasks, it is thus likely that a good model should not be overly complicated. **Could these both assumptions be introduced a priori into the architecture of the employed network?**

###### Model structure

To this end, the proposed system has a simple design coming in two flavors - ambient only or extended with sound event detectors that signal if a template match has occurred anywhere in the whole recording.

<p align="center"><img src="_images/model.png" alt="Model structure" title="Model structure" /></p>

The ambience processing model is evaluated with different frequency resolutions (`amb*` and `STFT`) and compared with models extended with 15 detector modules trained from scratch (`detectors`) or with a single detector pre-trained on hand-annotated fragments of `cafe/restaurant` recordings with sounds invovling cups, plates, etc. (`dishes`).

The results obtained in the experiments indicate that **a higher number of mel frequency bands quite uniformly improves the achieved validation accuracy for the ambience only model**. Unfortunately, the `detectors` variant shows signs of significant overfitting combined with relatively high training times. This effect is constrained when the detector array is limited to fine-tuning on one pre-trained module.

Looking at the filters in the first layer it seems that the ambience network mostly learns to discriminate frequency patterns, therefore it is a plausible explanation why a higher frequency resolution of the input data could be beneficial for classification.

Further examination would be needed to extrapolate this claim to other datasets and architectures, but preliminary results show that **spectrogram resolution could be an important factor influencing the behavior of models in audio classification tasks**. Another interesting extension would be to validate the concept of individual detector pre-training with more abundant annotation data and see if incorporating a priori domain knowledge about the problem could enhance the capabilities of the model.

    LaTeX source code for the paper.

- ##### [`/Submission/`](/Submission/)

    Actual submission package as delivered for [DCASE 2017](http://www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/arg/dcase2017/challenge/submission).

- ##### [`/Code`](/Code/)

    -   ###### `/Code/*.py`

        Source code for experiments.

        Run [`run_amb.py`](Code/run_amb.py) to train the ambience model:

        ```
        $ python run_amb.py -h

        usage: run_amb.py [-h] [-D DEVICE] [-b BANDS] [--all]

        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -D DEVICE, --device DEVICE
                                Theano device used for computations
          -b BANDS, --bands BANDS
                                Number of mel bands or `stft`
          --all                 Train on all folds (for final model testing)
        ```

        This will generate `run_{BANDS}_{FOLD}.*` files in the [`results/`](Code/results/) directory:

        - `run_{BANDS}_{FOLD}.h5` - saved weights (highest holdout score)
        - `run_{BANDS}_{FOLD}.last.h5` - saved weights (last epoch)
        - `run_{BANDS}_{FOLD}.npz` - training history
        - `run_{BANDS}_{FOLD}.txt` - generated predictions

        Settings used for training models in the paper:

        ```python
        BANDS in [40, 60, 100, 200, 'stft']
        ```

        The `--all` switch is used for training the final model (all training folds included).

        Issuing:

        ```shell
        $ python run_detectors.py
        ```

        will train a hybrid model (ambience module + 15 binary event detectors). [`run_dishes.py`](Code/run_dishes.py) is
        a streamlined version with only 1 binary detector pre-trained on typical `cafe/restaurant` sounds
        (kitchenware, cutlery, crockery etc.). Detector pre-training is done with [`train_clues.py`](Code/train_clues.py) based on [`clues.txt`](Code/clues.txt) annotations.

    - ###### [`/Code/results/`](/Code/results/)

        Training outputs. The [`eval.py`](Code/eval.py) script creates cross-validation accuracy metrics, list of misclassifications
        and a confusion matrix for a given system:

        ```
        $ python eval.py run_200
        ```

        The `_th_0.5` suffixes denote models with prediction thresholding, so:

        ```
        $ python eval.py run_200_th_0.5
        ```

        will generate a corresponding confusion matrix [`Code/results/run_200_th_0.5.pdf`](Code/results/run_200_th_0.5.pdf).
